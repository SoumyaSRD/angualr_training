    <p>
      Angular is a comprehensive, TypeScript-based web application framework
      developed and maintained by Google. Born from the lessons learned with
      AngularJS, Angular represents a complete reimagining of how to build
      modern web applications. It provides a robust, scalable solution for
      crafting dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) that prioritize developer
      productivity, exceptional performance, and long-term code maintainability.
    </p>

    <p>
      What sets Angular apart is its
      <strong>opinionated, full-stack approach</strong> to frontend development.
      Unlike minimal libraries that solve one problem, Angular is an
      enterprise-grade platform delivering an integrated ecosystem: component
      architecture, powerful dependency injection, sophisticated routing,
      reactive forms, HTTP client with interceptors, comprehensive testing
      utilities, internationalization support, and state management patterns.
      This unified vision eliminates the "framework fatigue" of assembling
      disparate tools and ensures consistency across teams, projects, and years
      of development.

    <h3>Core Features That Define Angular</h3>

    <!-- <mat-list class="feature-list">
      @for(feature of features; track $index){
      <mat-list-item>
        <mat-icon matListItemIcon>star</mat-icon>
        <div matListItemTitle>{{ feature.title }}</div>
        <div matListItemLine>{{ feature.description }}</div>
      </mat-list-item>
      }
    </mat-list> -->

    <h3>The Angular Philosophy: Opinionated Excellence</h3>
    <p>
      Angular embraces a "batteries-included" philosophy that stands in sharp
      contrast to the fragmented JavaScript ecosystem. Rather than forcing
      developers to navigate a maze of competing libraries for routing, state
      management, forms, and HTTP—Angular provides official, battle-tested
      solutions for every common need. This opinionated approach isn't about
      limiting choice; it's about eliminating decision paralysis and ensuring
      your application follows proven patterns that scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      The framework champions <strong>testability</strong> as a first-class
      concern. Dependency injection makes unit testing natural, TestBed provides
      powerful component testing utilities, and the entire architecture
      encourages separation of concerns. Angular applications are designed to be
      maintained for years, not months—with strong typing catching errors before
      they reach production, consistent patterns making onboarding seamless, and
      comprehensive tooling supporting large teams working on complex domains.
    </p>

    <h3>When Angular Shines</h3>
    <p>
      Angular excels in enterprise environments where multiple teams collaborate
      on large-scale applications with demanding requirements. If you're
      building complex admin dashboards, data-intensive business applications,
      or systems requiring strict consistency and governance—Angular's structure
      becomes an asset, not a constraint. The learning curve pays dividends in
      reduced bugs, faster onboarding, and sustainable long-term development.
    </p>

    <p>
      From Fortune 500 companies to innovative startups, Angular powers
      applications that demand reliability, performance, and maintainability at
      scale. With Google's continued investment, a vibrant community, and
      constant evolution incorporating modern web standards like
      <strong>signals</strong> and
      <strong>standalone components</strong>—Angular remains a compelling choice
      for serious web development in 2026 and beyond.

        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Choose Angular when you want structure,
        consistency, and long-term maintainability — especially in
        medium-to-large projects or enterprise settings.
