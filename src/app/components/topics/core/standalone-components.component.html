  <p>
    Standalone components, introduced in Angular 14 and becoming the default in
    Angular 17+, represent a major shift in how Angular applications are
    structured. Unlike traditional NgModule-based components, standalone
    components don't require declaration in an NgModule, simplifying the
    development experience and reducing boilerplate code.
  </p>

  <p>
    With standalone components, each component explicitly declares its
    dependencies through the
    <code>imports</code> array in the @Component decorator. This makes
    components more self-contained, easier to understand, and simpler to test.
    The standalone approach is now the recommended way to build Angular
    applications.
  </p>

  <h3>Benefits of Standalone Components</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Simplified Mental Model:</strong> No need to think about NgModule
      organization
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Less Boilerplate:</strong> Fewer files and less configuration
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Better Tree-Shaking:</strong> Unused imports are easier to
      eliminate
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Easier Testing:</strong> Components are self-contained units
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flexible Imports:</strong> Import only what you need, where you
      need it
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Modern Best Practice:</strong> Aligned with Angular's future
      direction
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Migration Path</h3>
  <p>
    Existing NgModule-based applications can gradually migrate to standalone
    components. Angular provides schematics to automate much of the migration
    process. Both approaches can coexist in the same application during the
    transition period.
