    Angular Modules (NgModules) are a fundamental concept used to organize an
    application into cohesive blocks of functionality. They help group related
    components, directives, pipes, and services together, making large
    applications easier to manage, maintain, and scale. Although standalone
    components are now recommended in modern Angular, understanding module types
    remains important, especially when working with existing applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Angular applications commonly use different types of modules such as Root,
    Feature, Shared, and Core modules. Each module type serves a specific purpose
    in structuring the application and promoting separation of concerns and code
    reusability.
  </p>

  <h3>Types of Angular Modules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Root Module (AppModule):</strong> The main entry point of the
      application. It bootstraps the root component and imports essential modules
      required to start the app.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Feature Modules:</strong> Modules designed for specific features or
      sections of the application (e.g., user, admin, dashboard). They help keep
      functionality isolated and support lazy loading.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shared Module:</strong> Contains reusable components, directives,
      and pipes that are used across multiple feature modules. It promotes code
      reuse and reduces duplication.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Core Module:</strong> Holds singleton services, global components,
      and application-wide functionality such as authentication, interceptors, or
      configuration services. Typically imported only once in the root module.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Benefits of Using Angular Modules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Better Organization:</strong> Helps structure large applications
      into logical units
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Code Reusability:</strong> Shared functionality can be reused across
      modules
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lazy Loading Support:</strong> Feature modules can be loaded on
      demand
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Clear boundaries between features
      and shared logic
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Easier to maintain and scale as the
      application grows
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Structured Dependency Management:</strong> Helps manage providers
      and dependencies effectively
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Modern Considerations</h3>
  <p>
    While NgModules remain relevant, modern Angular encourages the use of
    standalone components and APIs to reduce complexity. However, module-based
    architecture is still widely used and can coexist with standalone approaches
    during migration or in legacy applications.
