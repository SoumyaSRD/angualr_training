        Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows applications to load
        feature modules or components only when they are needed, instead of loading
        everything upfront during the initial application startup. This helps reduce
        the initial bundle size and improves application performance, especially for
        large-scale applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        With lazy loading, routes are configured to dynamically import components or
        modules using the Angular Router. When a user navigates to a specific route,
        Angular loads the required resources on demand. This results in faster initial
        load times and a more efficient user experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits of Lazy Loading</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Reduces initial bundle size for faster
            application startup
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Faster Initial Load:</strong> Loads only essential resources at
            first
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Better Resource Management:</strong> Features are loaded only when
            required
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> Ideal for large applications with multiple
            features
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optimized User Experience:</strong> Reduces waiting time during
            initial navigation
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> Encourages better separation of
            concerns
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implementation Approach</h3>
    <p>
        Lazy loading can be implemented using Angular Router by defining routes with
        dynamic imports through the <code>loadChildren</code> or
        <code>loadComponent</code> properties. Modern Angular applications using
        standalone components can directly lazy load components without creating
        NgModules, making the setup simpler and more flexible.
