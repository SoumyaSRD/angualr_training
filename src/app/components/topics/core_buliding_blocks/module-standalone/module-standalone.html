    <p>
        Angular applications can be built using either traditional NgModule-based
        architecture or the newer standalone component approach. NgModules were
        originally designed to organize components, directives, pipes, and services
        into cohesive units. Standalone components, introduced in Angular 14 and
        becoming the default in Angular 17+, simplify this architecture by allowing
        components to exist independently without requiring NgModule declarations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The module-based approach focuses on grouping related functionality into
        structured modules, which helps with large-scale organization but often
        introduces additional boilerplate and complexity. In contrast, standalone
        components declare their own dependencies directly using the
        <code>imports</code> property, making them more self-contained and easier to
        manage. Both approaches can coexist, and developers can choose based on
        project requirements or gradually migrate toward standalone architecture.
    </p>

    <h3>Module vs Standalone Components</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> NgModules require components to be declared
            inside a module, while standalone components operate independently.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Boilerplate:</strong> Module-based architecture involves additional
            configuration files; standalone reduces setup complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dependency Management:</strong> NgModules manage shared dependencies
            centrally, whereas standalone components define imports locally.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Modules traditionally handle lazy loading;
            standalone components enable direct lazy loading via router configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Learning Curve:</strong> NgModules introduce extra concepts for new
            developers; standalone offers a simpler mental model.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Standalone promotes modular, reusable, and
            composable design patterns.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When to Use Each Approach</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Use NgModules:</strong> When working with legacy applications or
            large teams already structured around module architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Use Standalone Components:</strong> For new projects, modern Angular
            best practices, and simpler project setup.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Hybrid Approach:</strong> Angular supports mixing both approaches,
            allowing gradual migration without rewriting existing features.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        While NgModules remain a valid organizational tool, standalone components
        represent Angular's modern direction by reducing complexity and improving
        developer experience. Understanding both approaches helps developers maintain
        legacy systems while adopting newer, more efficient patterns.
