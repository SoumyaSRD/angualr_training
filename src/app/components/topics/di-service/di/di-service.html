    <h3>Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular</h3>

    <p>
        Dependency Injection (DI) is a core design pattern in Angular that allows
        classes to receive their required dependencies from external sources rather
        than creating them manually. This approach promotes loose coupling between
        different parts of an application, improves code reusability, and makes
        testing easier. Instead of instantiating services directly inside a component,
        Angular provides them automatically through its built-in dependency injection
        system.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Angular, dependencies are typically services that contain shared logic,
        data access functionality, configuration, or state management. The Angular
        framework uses an injector to create and manage instances of these services
        and supply them wherever they are needed.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Dependency Injection is Important</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Loose Coupling:</strong> Components do not need to know how to create their dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Services can be reused across multiple components.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Easier to update or replace services without changing dependent
            components.</li>
        <li><strong>Testability:</strong> Dependencies can be mocked or replaced during testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized Management:</strong> Angular manages lifecycle and instantiation automatically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Dependency Injection Works</h3>

    <p>Angular's DI system consists of three main parts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> A class that provides functionality or data.</li>
        <li><strong>Injector:</strong> Responsible for creating and delivering service instances.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer:</strong> A component, directive, pipe, or another service that requires the dependency.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When Angular creates a component, it checks the constructor parameters and
        automatically injects the required dependencies if they are registered with
        the injector.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating and Injecting a Service</h3>

    <h4>Step 1: Create a Service</h4>

    <pre>
{{dataEg}}
</pre>

    <p>
        The <code>providedIn: 'root'</code> configuration registers the service in
        the root injector, making it available throughout the application as a
        singleton.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Inject Service into Component</h4>

    <pre>
{{dataEg2}}
</pre>

    <p>
        Angular automatically resolves the dependency and injects the service
        instance into the component.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Providers in Angular</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Root Provider:</strong> Registered globally using <code>providedIn: 'root'</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Component Provider:</strong> Local instance scoped to component tree.</li>
        <li><strong>Module Provider:</strong> Used in legacy NgModule-based apps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Injector Hierarchy</h3>

    <p>
        Angular uses a hierarchical injector system. Child components can access
        services from parent injectors or override them locally.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Root Injector — global application services.</li>
        <li>Component Injectors — scoped services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Modern Dependency Injection (Angular Standalone)</h3>

    <p>
        With standalone components, DI still works the same way. Angular also
        introduced the <code>inject()</code> function for functional injection.
    </p>

    <pre ngNonBindable>
const dataService = inject(DataService);
</pre>

    <h3>Advanced DI Concepts</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Injection Tokens:</strong> For non-class dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Injection:</strong> Prevent errors if dependency missing.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi Providers:</strong> Multiple values under one token.</li>
        <li><strong>Factory Providers:</strong> Dynamic creation logic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Use services for shared logic.</li>
        <li>Prefer <code>providedIn: 'root'</code>.</li>
        <li>Avoid heavy business logic in components.</li>
        <li>Scope services only when needed.</li>
        <li>Keep services single-responsibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        Dependency Injection keeps Angular applications modular, scalable, and easy
        to maintain by separating dependency creation from usage.
