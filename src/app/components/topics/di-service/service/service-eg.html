    <h3>Angular Services</h3>

    <p>
        Services are a fundamental concept in Angular used to organize and share
        reusable business logic, data access functionality, and application-wide
        features. Instead of placing complex logic inside components, Angular
        encourages developers to move such logic into services. This promotes clean
        architecture, improves maintainability, and allows multiple parts of an
        application to reuse the same functionality efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
        A service in Angular is typically a class that contains methods and data
        related to a specific feature or responsibility. Services are often used for
        tasks such as communicating with APIs, managing state, handling authentication,
        logging, or providing utility functions. Angular services are usually injected
        into components or other services using Dependency Injection (DI), ensuring
        that dependencies are managed automatically by the framework.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Use Services?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Keeps business logic separate from
            UI components.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Code Reusability:</strong> Logic can be reused across multiple
            components or modules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Easier to update or modify centralized
            logic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Testability:</strong> Services can be independently tested or mocked.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>State Management:</strong> Allows sharing data between components.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Creating a Service</h3>

    <p>
        Angular provides a simple way to create services using the
        <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator. This decorator marks the class as
        available for dependency injection.
    </p>

    <pre>
{{dataEg}}
</pre>

    <p>
        The <code>providedIn: 'root'</code> option registers the service in the root
        injector, meaning Angular creates a single shared instance (singleton) that
        can be used throughout the application.
    </p>

    <h3>Using a Service in a Component</h3>

    <p>
        Services are typically injected into components through the constructor.
        Angular automatically provides the service instance when the component is
        created.
    </p>

    <pre>
{{dataEg2}}
</pre>

    <h3>Common Use Cases for Services</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            API communication using HTTP requests.
        </li>
        <li>
            Authentication and authorization logic.
        </li>
        <li>
            Data sharing between unrelated components.
        </li>
        <li>
            State management and caching.
        </li>
        <li>
            Utility or helper functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Logging, analytics, and error handling.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Service Scope and Providers</h3>

    <p>
        Angular allows services to be scoped at different levels depending on how
        they are provided.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Root Provider:</strong> Registered globally using
            <code>providedIn: 'root'</code>. Creates a singleton shared across the app.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Component Provider:</strong> Defined in a component's
            <code>providers</code> array, creating a new instance for that component
            tree.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Module Provider:</strong> Used in NgModule-based applications.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Service Communication and State Sharing</h3>

    <p>
        Services are often used as a central place to manage shared state. For example,
        a service can store data and expose methods or Observables that multiple
        components subscribe to. This avoids direct component-to-component
        communication and makes the application architecture more scalable.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern Angular Services (Standalone Architecture)</h3>

    <p>
        In modern Angular applications using standalone components, services are still
        provided through dependency injection. Angular also introduced the
        <code>inject()</code> function, which allows services to be injected without
        using constructors, especially useful in signals, functional guards, or
        factory functions.
    </p>

    <pre ngNonBindable>
const dataService = inject(DataService);
</pre>

    <h3>Best Practices for Services</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Keep services focused on a single responsibility.
        </li>
        <li>
            Avoid placing UI logic inside services.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use services to handle API calls instead of components.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prefer root-level services unless scoped instances are required.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make services reusable and loosely coupled.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        Angular services play a crucial role in building scalable and maintainable
        applications. By separating logic from components and using dependency
        injection, services help create clean architecture, reusable code, and better
        testable applications. Understanding how to design and use services effectively
        is essential for mastering Angular development.
