  <p>
    Angular is a comprehensive, TypeScript-based web application framework
    developed and maintained by Google. It provides a complete solution for
    building dynamic, scalable single-page applications (SPAs) with a focus on
    developer productivity, application performance, and code maintainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike libraries that focus on specific aspects of development, Angular is a
    full-fledged framework providing everything you need: component
    architecture, dependency injection, routing, forms, HTTP client, testing
    utilities, and more. This opinionated approach ensures consistency across
    large teams and projects.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Component-Based Architecture:</strong> Build encapsulated,
      reusable UI components
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>TypeScript:</strong> Strong typing for better tooling and error
      detection
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Built-in DI system for managing
      dependencies
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reactive Programming:</strong> RxJS integration for handling
      asynchronous operations
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Two-Way Data Binding:</strong> Automatic synchronization between
      model and view
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Powerful CLI:</strong> Code generation, development server, and
      build optimization
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Routing:</strong> Client-side navigation with lazy loading support
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Forms:</strong> Template-driven and reactive forms with validation
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Angular Philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    Angular follows a batteries-included philosophy, providing official
    solutions for common needs rather than leaving developers to choose from
    multiple third-party libraries. This reduces decision fatigue and ensures
    better long-term maintainability. The framework emphasizes testability,
    modularity, and following best practices out of the box.
