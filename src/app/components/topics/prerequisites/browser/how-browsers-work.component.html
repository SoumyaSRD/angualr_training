    Understanding how browsers work is fundamental for web developers. Modern
    browsers are complex applications that parse HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
    render web pages. The browser engine performs multiple steps to transform
    code into the visual pages users interact with.
  </p>

  <p>
    The browser's main components include the User Interface, Browser Engine,
    Rendering Engine, Networking, JavaScript Interpreter, UI Backend, and Data
    Storage. When you navigate to a URL, the browser initiates a complex process
    involving DNS lookup, TCP connection, HTTP request/response, and finally
    rendering the content.
  </p>

  <h3>The Rendering Process</h3>
  <p>
    The rendering engine follows a critical path to display content. First, it
    parses HTML to construct the DOM (Document Object Model) tree.
    Simultaneously, it parses CSS to build the CSSOM (CSS Object Model). These
    two trees are combined to create the Render Tree, which contains only the
    nodes required to render the page with their computed styles.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the Render Tree is constructed, the browser performs Layout (also
    called Reflow) to calculate the exact position and size of each element.
    Finally, the Paint step converts the render tree into actual pixels on the
    screen. Modern browsers also use GPU acceleration for certain operations to
    improve performance.

    <li><strong>DOM Construction:</strong> Parse HTML into a tree of nodes</li>
    <li><strong>CSSOM Construction:</strong> Parse CSS into style rules</li>
    <li><strong>Render Tree:</strong> Combine DOM and CSSOM</li>

    <li><strong>Composite:</strong> Layer composition for final display</li>
