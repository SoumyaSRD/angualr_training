    <h3>Routing & Navigation in Angular</h3>

    <p>
        Routing and navigation are essential features in Angular that enable the
        creation of Single Page Applications (SPAs). Instead of reloading the entire
        page when navigating between views, Angular dynamically updates the content
        within the application using its built-in Router. This provides faster
        navigation, better performance, and a smoother user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Angular Router allows developers to map URLs to specific components, manage
        application states, enable lazy loading, handle route guards for security, and
        control navigation programmatically. It plays a crucial role in structuring
        large applications by dividing them into multiple views or pages.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Concepts of Angular Routing</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Routes:</strong> Define mappings between URL paths and components.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Router Outlet:</strong> Placeholder directive where routed
            components are displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>RouterLink:</strong> Directive used to navigate between routes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Navigation:</strong> Programmatic or declarative movement between
            views.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Route Parameters:</strong> Dynamic values passed through URLs.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Basic Routing Setup</h3>

    <p>
        In modern Angular (standalone architecture), routes are typically defined in
        a separate routes configuration file. Each route specifies a path and the
        component that should be displayed when that path is accessed.
    </p>

    <pre>
{{dataRoutingEg}}
</pre>

    <h3>Router Outlet</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> directive acts as a dynamic container
        where Angular renders the component associated with the active route.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</pre>

    <h3>Navigation Using RouterLink</h3>

    <p>
        Angular provides the <code>routerLink</code> directive for declarative
        navigation. It allows users to navigate between routes without reloading the
        page.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;a routerLink="/about"&gt;Go to About&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

    <h3>Programmatic Navigation</h3>

    <p>
        Developers can navigate using the Router service, which is useful when
        navigation depends on logic or events such as form submissions.
    </p>

    <pre>
{{dataNavEg}}
</pre>

    <h3>Route Parameters</h3>

    <p>
        Route parameters allow dynamic data to be passed through URLs. Components can
        access these parameters using the ActivatedRoute service.
    </p>

    <pre>
{{dataParamEg}}
</pre>

    <h3>Child Routes and Nested Routing</h3>

    <p>
        Angular supports nested routes, allowing complex layouts with multiple router
        outlets. Child routes help organize related views under a parent route.
    </p>

    <pre>
        {{dataEg}}

</pre>

    <h3>Lazy Loading Routes</h3>

    <p>
        Lazy loading improves performance by loading feature modules or standalone
        components only when required. This reduces initial bundle size and speeds up
        application startup.
    </p>

    <pre>
{{dataLazyEg}}
</pre>

    <h3>Route Guards</h3>

    <p>
        Route guards control access to routes based on conditions such as
        authentication or permissions. Angular provides several guard types:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>CanActivate:</strong> Prevents unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>CanDeactivate:</strong> Prevents leaving a route.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Fetches data before navigation.</li>
        <li><strong>CanLoad:</strong> Controls lazy-loaded routes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Navigation Events</h3>

    <p>
        Angular Router emits events during navigation such as start, end, cancel, or
        error events. Developers can subscribe to these events for logging, loading
        indicators, or analytics.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern Routing (Standalone Angular)</h3>

    <p>
        Modern Angular applications use <code>provideRouter()</code> during
        application bootstrap instead of module-based routing. This aligns with the
        standalone architecture and reduces boilerplate.
    </p>

    <pre>
<!-- bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes)]
}); -->
</pre>

    <h3>Best Practices for Routing</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Use lazy loading for large feature areas.
        </li>
        <li>
            Organize routes logically to improve maintainability.
        </li>
        <li>
            Protect sensitive routes using guards.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use route parameters instead of global state when possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keep route configuration simple and readable.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        Angular Routing enables efficient navigation and dynamic view rendering in
        single-page applications. By mapping URLs to components, supporting lazy
        loading, and providing advanced navigation features, Angular Router helps
        developers build scalable, performant, and user-friendly applications.
