    <h3>Observable vs Promise Introduction</h3>

    <p>
        Observables and Promises are both used in Angular and JavaScript to handle
        asynchronous operations such as HTTP requests, user events, timers, and data
        streams. While they may seem similar at first, they serve different purposes
        and offer different capabilities. Understanding the differences between
        Observables and Promises is essential for building reactive, scalable, and
        efficient Angular applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Promises represent a single future value that will eventually be resolved or
        rejected, whereas Observables represent streams of data that can emit multiple
        values over time. Angular heavily relies on Observables through the RxJS
        library, especially for HTTP communication and reactive programming patterns.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a Promise?</h3>

    <p>
        A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion or
        failure of an asynchronous operation. Once resolved, a promise delivers a
        single value and cannot emit additional values afterward.

    <h4>Key Characteristics of Promises</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Handles a single asynchronous result.</li>
        <li>Executes immediately once created.</li>
        <li>Cannot be cancelled once started.</li>
        <li>Uses <code>then()</code>, <code>catch()</code>, and <code>finally()</code>.</li>
        <li>Common in plain JavaScript APIs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is an Observable?</h3>

    <p>
        An Observable is a powerful abstraction provided by RxJS that represents a
        stream of asynchronous data over time. Observables can emit multiple values,
        support cancellation, and provide advanced operators for transforming and
        combining data streams.

</pre>

    <h4>Key Characteristics of Observables</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Can emit multiple values over time.</li>
        <li>Lazy execution (runs only when subscribed).</li>
        <li>Supports cancellation via unsubscribe.</li>
        <li>Provides powerful operators like map, filter, debounce, etc.</li>
        <li>Heavily used in Angular HTTP and reactive programming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Differences Between Observable and Promise</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Execution:</strong> Promises execute immediately; Observables execute
            only when subscribed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Values:</strong> Promises resolve once; Observables can emit multiple
            values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cancellation:</strong> Promises cannot be cancelled; Observables can
            be unsubscribed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Operators:</strong> Observables provide rich operators for data
            transformation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Angular Usage:</strong> Angular commonly uses Observables with HTTP
            and reactive forms.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When to Use Promise</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Simple one-time asynchronous operations.</li>
        <li>Working with standard JavaScript APIs.</li>
        <li>When reactive streams are not required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When to Use Observable</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Handling streams of events or data.</li>
        <li>HTTP requests in Angular.</li>
        <li>Reactive programming scenarios.</li>
        <li>Real-time updates or user interactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        While Promises are useful for handling single asynchronous results,
        Observables provide a more powerful and flexible approach for managing
        multiple asynchronous data streams. Angular promotes Observables because they
        enable reactive patterns, better cancellation control, and advanced data
        handling capabilities. Understanding both concepts helps developers choose
        the right tool based on application requirements.
