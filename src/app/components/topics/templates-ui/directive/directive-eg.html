    <h3>Angular Directives</h3>

    <p>
      Directives are one of the core building blocks in Angular that allow
      developers to extend the behavior of HTML elements. They provide a way to
      manipulate the DOM, apply dynamic styling, control rendering, and add custom
      logic to elements without creating new components. Directives help keep
      templates clean, reusable, and maintainable by encapsulating behavior in a
      structured and reusable way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Angular provides several built-in directives that help developers manage
      dynamic UI behavior such as conditionally displaying elements, looping
      through collections, or applying styles. In addition to built-in directives,
      developers can also create custom directives to implement reusable logic
      tailored to specific application needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Angular Directives</h3>

    <p>
      Angular directives are generally categorized into three main types based on
      their purpose and functionality.
    </p>

    <h4>1. Component Directives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Components are technically directives with a template.
      </li>
      <li>
        They define a custom HTML element with its own view, styles, and behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        Components encapsulate UI structure and business logic together.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Structural Directives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Structural directives modify the DOM layout by adding, removing, or
        rearranging elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        They typically use the <code>*</code> syntax.
      </li>
      <li>
        Common examples include:
        <ul>
          <li><code>*ngIf</code> — conditionally adds or removes elements.</li>
          <li><code>*ngFor</code> — repeats elements for each item in a list.</li>
          <li><code>*ngSwitch</code> — displays elements based on conditions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Structural directives work by transforming the DOM structure during
        rendering.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h4>3. Attribute Directives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of existing DOM
        elements without altering the structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are applied as HTML attributes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Examples include:
        <ul>
          <li><code>ngClass</code> — dynamically adds or removes CSS classes.</li>
          <li><code>ngStyle</code> — applies inline styles dynamically.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Custom Directives</h3>

    <p>
      Custom directives allow developers to create reusable behavior that can be
      applied across multiple components. Instead of repeating logic in templates,
      custom directives encapsulate specific interactions or DOM manipulations in a
      single reusable unit. This improves code reusability, readability, and
      maintainability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Custom directives are especially useful for handling common UI interactions
      such as highlighting elements, handling permissions, custom animations,
      tracking user actions, or applying dynamic styling based on conditions.
    </p>

    <h4>Creating a Custom Attribute Directive</h4>

    <p>
      To create a custom directive, Angular provides the
      <code>@Directive</code> decorator. Developers define a selector that is used
      as an attribute in HTML, and then implement logic inside the directive class.
    </p>



    <p>
      In this example, the directive applies a background color to any element that
      uses the <code>appHighlight</code> attribute.
    </p>

    <h4>Using a Custom Directive</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;p appHighlight&gt;This text is highlighted using a custom directive.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

    <h3>Key Features of Custom Directives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Reusability:</strong> Write logic once and apply it across multiple
        components.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Keeps templates clean by moving
        behavior into reusable classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>DOM Interaction:</strong> Can modify styles, attributes, or respond
        to events.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Event Handling:</strong> Listen to events like click, hover, focus,
        etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Behavior:</strong> Apply logic based on inputs or external
        data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Demo of Custom Directives</h3>

    <div class="live-demo">
      <div *appVisibleIf="true">
        Always visible
      </div>

      <div *appVisibleIf="'admin'">
        Only admin role sees this
      </div>

      <div *appVisibleIf="visible">
        Only admin role sees this
      </div>

      <button (click)="visible = !visible">give me access</button>
    </div>



    <h3>Best Practices for Using Directives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep directives focused on a single responsibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid excessive DOM manipulation; use Angular bindings where possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use input properties to make directives configurable and flexible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prefer directives for behavior reuse instead of duplicating template logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine directives with standalone components for modern Angular
        architecture.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
      Directives enhance Angular applications by enabling reusable behaviors and
      dynamic UI manipulation. Built-in directives simplify common tasks, while
      custom directives allow developers to extend functionality based on specific
      application needs. Proper use of directives leads to cleaner templates,
      improved maintainability, and scalable application architecture.
